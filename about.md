Hi I'm Shaughn Finnerty, a fourth year CS student at University of Ottawa with a passion for exploring all things tech.
While I haven't figured out a specific area on which to focus this blog, I've decided for the time being 
to dedicate it as a place to share all of my exploratory successes and failures. 

When I am not at my desk studying or behind my keyboard, I enjoy hunting, fishing, snowboarding, wakeboarding - pretty 
well all things outdoors. Beginner photography is also an interest of mine (stress on beginner), as well as playing
guitar.
 
Since starting CS studies, I have had various work experience as a software developer at Versaterm, NetFore Systems, and some very
cool government organizations.  

Got a cool, up and coming framework, plugin, or app you want to share?
Want me to write about a specific topic?
Want to discuss or work on some projects?
Shoot me a message!
